## Question:

```
You keep noticing a weird string in your log files. Decipher the string for the challenge flag!

The string in question is: "vevf!"
```

## Solution:

This one was so simple it actually thew me off. The plain text looking string should queue you in that it's not anything super challenging. A [Rot 13 Cipher](https://rot13.com) quickly shows the solution. Just make sure the exclimation point is there!
